# CNN-RelationExtraction
Convolution neural network for relation extraction between two given entities

The Architecture inspired by two papers in the references: 
- CNN for sentence classication : in which a CNN is built on top of Wordvector representation of each word + additional word based features 
- CNN for relation extraction : in which additional sentence based features are added including two head words to find relations between them
